**Inspiration**
ÓPHELEIA was imagined from the pressure and fast-paced environment in the hackathon SheInnovates. Originally, our team planned to build a health community blog; however, as the competition started, we decided to solve a more technical, high-impact problem in the given categories. We pivoted to focus on the technical intricacies of Product Management, creating a tool that bridges the gap between raw data and actionable strategy.

**What it does**
Our website, ÓPHELEIA, serves as the middleman for product managers to access easily compiled data. By inputting a product, its demographic, and goal, an itemized markdown file or dashboard visual of the overview, market insights, component failure and success, user feedback, and risk mitigation is provided. Users can then export this intelligence into Markdown, JSON, or CSV formats to seamlessly integrate into their existing workflows in tools like Trello or Jira.

**How we built it**
Our project uses a full-stack architecture as follows:

- Frontend: React Native (Vite)
- Backend: Node.js
- Intelligence: Claude (Anthropic) API with custom prompt engineering
- Environment: Visual Studio Code 
- Language: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
i.e., the questions input aid the prompt to assist with the Claude API to gather data and output that into a markdown file.

**Challenges we ran into**
During creation, the user interface was a major hurdle. Specifically managing grid sizing and ensuring the output box is integrated into the design. Moreover, ensuring that the prompt is properly working, and the AI-generated content is correctly transformed into structured CSV and JSON files without losing data integrity during the download process.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We are proud of our ability to pivot under pressure. Successfully connecting the frontend to the backend was a massive milestone for us. Beyond the code, we are proud of our attention to detail in implementing features to improve the user experience and successfully managing the logic.

**What we learned**
Overall, the project was a crash course in full-stack development. We learned the nuances of React, building robust Node.js servers, and the logic behind file generation and downloads. We also gained an understanding of the duties of a Product Manager and what could best assist them in their work.

**What's next for ÓPHELEIA**
The team behind ÓPHELEIA plans to continue our passion for building tools that aid the community and streamline the tech industry. Using our past and future experiences and knowledge to further our careers and personal lives.
